## Our History

Assurance Hospitality is a provider of hospitality products and services across various accommodation alternatives and price ranges through its portfolio of brands.
We became an independent, pure-play hospitality company on August 1, 2000. Since then, the Company has developed into a well-respected leader in the hospitality industry.

## Our Mission

We welcomes people to experience travel the way they want.

## Our Core Values

* Act with integrity in all that we do: Without integrity, the foundations of business and life crumble.
* Respect everyone, everywhere: Whether we are working with a customer, a hotel franchisee, a senior executive or a security guard - respect knows no boundaries.
* Provide individual opportunity and accountability: As leaders, we need to actively include diversity in our thought process.
* Improve our customers' lives: Whether we are helping our hotel franchisees or resort affiliates with their businesses or creating memorable experiences for the guests visiting our properties â€” we strive to improve their lives through their interaction with us.
* Support our communities: Assurance Hospitality is committed to improving the lives of future generations around the world through conservation, education, and wellness.
